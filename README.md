# Experiment-7

Aim:

To study and implement C++ Arrays and Strings

Theory:

(A). C++ arrays are collections of elements with mutually inclusive types which stay together in one contiguous memory space. They can be declared by presenting the type of these elements followed by square brackets that hold their numbers. In other words, arrays begin counting from zero; thus for instance character zero on array becomes the first one while second one becomes character one and so forth. C++ arrays have fixed sizes that must be determined at compile time.

(B). In C++, strings are managed through either C-style string or by utilizing the string class which is included in the Standard Library. In this programming language, strings are made up of groups of characters terminated by a null character (‘\0’). Actions on C-styled strings are done by functions from C standard library like strlen, strcpy and strcat.
